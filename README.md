# GboardHook-NanashiTheNameless

**ALL CREDIT GOES TO <https://github.com/chenyue404/GboardHook> THIS IS A MODIFIED/TRANSLATED FORK FOR MY PERSONAL USE**

Modify clipboard display count and expiration time

enable_clipboard_entity_extraction and enable_clipboard_query_refactoring affect the number of clipboard entries that can be read. The principle is unclear, and the key code hasn't been found, so they can only be hardcoded to false for now 🤪

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```
